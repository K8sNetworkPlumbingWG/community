# Network Plumbing Working Group

The Network Plumbing Working Group (NPWG) was formed at Kubecon '17 in Austin to initially work towards implementing 
a common standard addressing how one may attach multiple networks to pods in Kubernetes. Our work has culminated in a 
de-facto standard CRD.

Join us for our bi-weekly meeting at 9:30AM Eastern Time on Thursday, opposite weeks from the SIG-Network meeting. We
meet in the same [Zoom channel](https://zoom.us/j/361123509) as is used for SIG-Network.

The de-facto standard for the CRD exists in our [multi-net-spec](https://github.com/K8sNetworkPlumbingWG/multi-net-spec) GitHub repo.
